# Terms and Concepts #3 - Meiosis (from Dr. Brett Couch)

• Terms for the stages of meiosis and the major events occurring at each stage:

    Meiosis I
        Prophase I, Metaphase I, etc. (you should be able to diagram cells at different stages especially metaphase I and anaphase I)
    Meiosis II
        Prophase II, Metaphase II, etc. (you should be able to diagram cells at different stages, following from meiosis I, especially metaphase I and anaphase I and the resultant products)
        Be able to work backwards through meiosis.
    Crossing over (when does it occur, what is the outcome)
    Independent assortment (what is it and when does it occur; you should be able to diagram this process)
    Segregation (when does it occur if crossing over occurs and if crossing over does not occur)
    Recombination
    Homologous chromosomes (what are they, how to identify them, how to diagram them)
    Linkage (physical linkages

 

 

• Terms related to the creation of genetic variation in gametes

        crossing-over and recombination
        independent assortment of homologous chromosomes
        segregation (if individual is heterozygous for an allele)
        random fusion of eggs and sperm

    Terms related to fertilization
        Zygote
        Gamete
        Somatic cell
        Random fusion of gametes
