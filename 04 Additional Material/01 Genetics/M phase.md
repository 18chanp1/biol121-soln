# M Phase of the Cell Cycle - Nucleus Biology Video

Here is the link for the video that I showed for mitosis:   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bq1To_RKEo

Unfortunately, the person who produced this video will not allow it to be shown on other platforms; so, you will need to watch it on You-Tube.

A few points of clarification:

- For BIOL121, you do not need to know what a nucleolus is or what centrioles are; nor do you need to know differences in cytokinesis between plant and animal cells.
- This video only refers to 4 mitotic phases (i.e. does not include prometaphase).  For BIOL121, we will refer to 5 mitotic phases.  Prometaphase starts when the nuclear membrance starts to disassemble and the spindle fibres attach to the chromosomes. 
- The spindle fibres are actually attaching to a protein patch on the centromere called a kinetochore (not directly to the DNA).
- Rather than equator, I will use the term metaphase plate (which is not an actual structure).
- CORRECTION:  In the discussion of Anaphase, the narrator states that the chromosomes are single-stranded.  This is incorrect.  DNA is a double-stranded molecule.
