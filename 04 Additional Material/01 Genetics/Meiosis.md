Meiosis - Nucleus Biology Video

Hi,

The creator of the Nucleus Biology - Meiosis video does not allow this video to be shown on platforms other than you-tube.  So I can't link the video here.  Sorry!

But, here is the You-tube link so that you can watch this video on You-tube:

A few additions/corrections

1.  Correction:  The DNA replicates before the start of Meiosis (not during prophase as implied in this video)

2.  Correction:  The narrator suggests that the terms crossing-over and recombination are interchangeable.  They are not.  Crossing-over is a PROCESS.  During crossing-over, specialized enzymes break the DNA at the same location on non-sister chromatids during early prophase.  When the repair machinery comes in, rather than reattaching the broken segments to the original chromatid, the broken segments are attached to the non-sister chromatids.  So, paternal and maternal DNA is exchanged.  Recombination is the OUTCOME of crossing-over, i.e.  the chromosomes in each of the 4 progeny/daughter cells carry a unique combination of maternal and paternal DNA and alleles as a result of crossing-over.  This is one source of genetic variation amongst gametes.  We will discuss this point in class in more detail.

3.  Addition:  A point not covered in this video is that, during Metaphase I, the homologous pairs align at the metaphase plate independently from each other, i.e.  there is not a maternal side and paternal side.   The outcome is that the eggs or sperm cells contain a random combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes.  This is a second source of genetic variation.  We will discuss this point in class.
