Study Sheet:
You can bring ONE 8.5" x 11" two-sided study sheet into the exam.   - you study sheet can include any content of your choosing, but it must be in your handwriting.   For our section, it is okay to handwrite your study sheet on your tablet/iPad, but you must print out your study sheet.  And, please do not use shape functions, etc. (everything must be handwritten). 
 We recommend that you bring a calculator  to the exam as we could ask you a question about proabilities.  Plain or scientific (non-programmable calculators) are allowed.  I will bring 3 or 4 calculators with us to the exam, but they will need to be shared.
 
Practice Questions below.   Answer keys will be made available before the midterm (likely Tuesday or Wednesday of next week).   Please know that some of the questions involve using data from genetic crosses to determine mode of inheritance and pedigrees  We will cover this topic next week on Tuesday and Thursday.
